# JavaScript resources

For many iViewer users, JavaScript is new and maybe not very well understood. We have compiled a list of resources we found useful for ourselves, and that you may want to use:

## Online references:

Among all existing sites, Mozilla's JavaScript Dev Center is certainly the most useful while writing JavaScript code. It's a very well organized reference on the language itself, and on the built-in objects and functions it provides.

* [Mozilla's JavaScript Dev Center](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript): The most usable JavaScript reference. **A must-read**.
* [Essential JavaScript Patterns](http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/)
* [JavaScript Garden](http://bonsaiden.github.com/JavaScript-Garden/): a compilation of tips and best practices
* [JavaScript gotchas](http://www.codeproject.com/KB/scripting/javascript-gotchas.aspx): a collection of gotchas for developers new to the language

There are sites specialized in *learning* the language itself:

* [CodeCademy](http://www.codecademy.com)
* [Learn JavaScript](http://learn.appendto.com/)


## Books:

* [JavaScript: The Definitive Guide](http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596805531): a book by David Flanagan covering all aspects of JavaScript and gives a good introduction to the language.
* [JavaScript: The Good Parts](http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596517748): a book by Douglas Crockford that details the good and bad parts of the JavaScript language, and gives a set of recommandations.
